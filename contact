            Welcome to our private BETA testing!

            Bonly is a FREE GIVEAWAY platform where prizes are paid by advertisers and are 100% free for the users.

            HOW DOES IT WORK?
            Get points by answering questions.
            Swap points for free prize draws.
            Keep your fingers crossed!

            TEST PERIOD
            This app is our first prototype that will be improved significantly before the official launch.

            The goal of this test period is to measure the functionality of the app and gather feedback from the people for future improvements.

            Test period lasts for 3 weeks.
            Every week there will be 20 new questions.
            Right answer to a question gives you 2 points, wrong answer 0 points.
            Use points to select your favorable giveaways.
            The more points you spend on a giveaway, the higher the change of winning.

            Prizes are drawn after the 3rd week. Therefore, we advise you to choose the preferred giveaways only after answering 3rd week questions. Otherwise you might spend your points too early and not be able to participate in other prize draws.

            Main Prize: JBL Speaker
            Quantity of Prizes: 10
            Participation Deadline: 17.01.2021
            Winners Announced: 18.01.2021

            Winners will be announced on Bonly platform and will be contacted privately.

            NB! Prizes such as iPhone and PlayStation 5 are representing our vision of future giveaways and are not available during BETA testing.

            Feel free to express your feedback to a friend who invited you to participate in this test experiment as it gives us valuable information from which we can improve the platform.

            Good luck, may the odds be ever in your favor!
